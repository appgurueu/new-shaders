(new) Shaders for Minetest
===================

This project extends the Minetest (https://github.com/minetest/minetest) OpenGL shaders to make things pretty and hopefully faster.

The goals of this project are the following:

 - Develop and ensure high quality graphics at these levels
	 - Minimal graphical enhancements (all options turned off, basic Minetest game)
	 - Moderate graphical enhancements
	 - 'Ultra' graphical enhancements, for high end gaming systems
 - User opt-in and toggle-ability of graphical features
 - Documentation and maintenance of code
 - Strong synchronization and comparability with main Minetest code
